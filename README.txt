ACRON REST API
The REST API is a programming interface that provides selected ACRON functions for third-party applications.

Details on configuration and usage can be found in the API developer documentation or the ACRON users guide included in your ACRON install.

This project aims to provide a starting point for developers working on a client application utilizing the ACRON REST API.

When developing a .NET application, the included DataContracts may be used for serialization and deserialization of data passed to and from the ACRON REST API.
